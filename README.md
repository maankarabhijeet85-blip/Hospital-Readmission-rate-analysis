# Objectives
Profile readmission distribution across demographics (age, race, gender) and encounter variables (procedures, emergencies, inpatient/outpatient use). 

Quantify bivariate relationships (e.g., emergencies vs. readmission) and compare readmission means across cohorts (e.g., diabetes-medication change vs. no change).
